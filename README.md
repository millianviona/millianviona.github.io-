### Project 1: Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis
---

This project uses the **Iowa Liquor Sales** dataset from BigQuery Public Datasets.  
The analysis explores sales trends, store performance, and unusual data entries (such as negative bottles sold).

#### Dataset
- Source: [BigQuery Public Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/iowa-department-of-commerce/iowa-liquor-sales)  
- Table: `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`

#### Key Questions
- Which stores sell the most liquor?
- What are the most popular products?
- Are there any anomalies in the data (e.g., negative bottles sold)?

#### Assumption
I only account positive values. 

#### Queries
**1. Which cities sell the most liquor?**
   
```
SELECT 
  city,
  ROUND(SUM(sale_dollars)) AS total_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE sale_dollars > 0
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
```
This query shows the top 10 cities with the biggest sales.

**2. Which stores sell the most liquor?**

```
SELECT 
  store_name,
  city,
  ROUND(SUM(sale_dollars)) AS total_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE sale_dollars > 0
GROUP BY city, store_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
```

This query shows the top 10 stores that sells or earns the most revenue.
