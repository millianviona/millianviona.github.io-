# Google BigQuery Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my Google BigQuery portfolio. Here you will find a collection of my projects in data analytics, including work with SQL, R, Tableau, Excel, and BigQuery.  
Iâ€™m passionate about turning data into insights and sharing my learning journey.

### Project 1: Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis
---

This project uses the **Iowa Liquor Sales** dataset from BigQuery Public Datasets.  
The analysis explores sales trends, store performance, and unusual data entries (such as negative bottles sold).

#### Dataset
- Source: [BigQuery Public Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/iowa-department-of-commerce/iowa-liquor-sales)  
- Table: `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`

#### Key Questions
- Which stores sell the most liquor?
- What are the most popular products?
- Are there any anomalies in the data (e.g., negative bottles sold)?

#### Assumption
I only account positive values. 

#### Queries
**1. Which cities sell the most liquor?**
   
```
SELECT 
  city,
  ROUND(SUM(sale_dollars)) AS total_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE sale_dollars > 0
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
##This query shows the top 10 cities with the biggest sales.
```

**2. Which stores sell the most liquor?**

```
SELECT 
  store_name,
  city,
  ROUND(SUM(sale_dollars)) AS total_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE sale_dollars > 0
GROUP BY city, store_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
##This query shows the top 10 stores that sells or earns the most revenue. 
```

**3. What are the top product categories by average revenue**

```
SELECT 
  category_name,
  ROUND(AVG(bottles_sold)) AS avg_bottles_sold,
  ROUND(AVG(sale_dollars)) AS avg_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE 
  sale_dollars > 0 AND
  bottles_sold > 0
GROUP BY category_name
ORDER BY avg_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
##This query shows the top 10 product categories that has the most average bottles sold and average revenue.
##There are 50 product categories in total. I only include 10 to make it more compact.

**4. What are the total revenue, profit, and units sold??**

```
SELECT 
  ROUND(SUM(bottles_sold)) AS total_bottles_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(sale_dollars)) AS total_revenue,
  ROUND(SUM((state_bottle_retail-state_bottle_cost) * bottles_sold)) AS total_profit
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE 
  sale_dollars > 0 AND
  bottles_sold > 0 AND
  state_bottle_retail > 0 AND
  state_bottle_cost > 0
```

**5. What bottle sizes that are the most preferred?**

```
SELECT 
  bottle_volume_ml AS bottle_size_ml,
  SUM(bottles_sold) AS total_bottles_sold
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
WHERE 
  bottles_sold > 0
GROUP BY
  bottle_size_ml
ORDER BY
  total_bottles_sold DESC
LIMIT 10
```

    SUM(sale_dollars) AS total_revenue
  FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
  WHERE sale_dollars > 0
  GROUP BY year
)

SELECT 
  year,
  ROUND(total_revenue, 2) AS total_revenue,
  CONCAT(
    CAST(ROUND(
      (total_revenue - LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year)) 
      / LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year) * 100, 
      2
    ) AS STRING),
